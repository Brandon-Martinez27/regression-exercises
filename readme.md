# Machine Learning Regression Exercises
## Goals
- Gather structured data from SQL to Pandas
- Summarize the data through aggregates, descriptive stats and distribution plots (histograms, density plots, boxplots, e.g.).
- Convert datatypes and handle missing values.
- Sample the data so that we are only using part of our available data to analyze and model. We will discuss the reasons for doing this. This is known as "Train, Validate, Test Splitting". 
- Understand the importance of "scaling" data.
- Understand the meaning of "drivers", variables vs. features, and the target variable. 
- Understand the importance of documenting your questions and hypotheses, how to answer them, and documenting takeaways and answers at each step of exploration.
- Use visualization techniques (scatterplots, jointplot, pairgrid, heatmap) to identify drivers. 
- Analyze the drivers of a continuous variable using appropriate statistical tests (t-tests and correlation tests).
- Learn ways to identify, select and create features through feature engineering methods, specifically feature importance.
- Understand Curse of Dimentionality
- Understand the importance of a "baseline model" and ways to establish that.
- Build linear regression models to extract the patterns the data is demonstrating and return to us a mathematical model or function that will predict the target variable. 
- Compare regression models by computing "evaluation metrics".
- Select a model and test the model on the unseen data sample.
